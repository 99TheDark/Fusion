# TODO
- Custom number parser
- Split each file into multiple
    - AST into misc, meta, node, statements & expressions
    - Parser into basic, raw, other, statements & expressions
    - Checker into basic, statements & expressions
    - Tokens into token, types, and consts
    - Scope into scope & variable
- Add table of functions (and eventually class + structs) in a `Program` struct
- Parse function calls
- Check function calls
- Modes
    - Comments
    - Strings
- Reverse operator precedence
- Struct parsing
- Pretty print AST
- Class parsing
- Auto calculation
    - Combine negative sign and number to make a negative number
    - Some expression like `(5 * 4.2 / 3 - 17 + 2 ^ 4) ^ 0.4` automatically becomes just `2.047673`...
- String interpolation
